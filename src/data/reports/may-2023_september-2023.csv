 * Our total staff went from 33 in 1/2023 to 41 in 7/2023.
 * Of our staff as of 1/28/23, we only lost 4 staff members. Mainly reasons out of LOA's control. (moving, leaving childcare altogether)
 * This grant has supported 8 new jobs. 
New hires: 
 * We hired 24 new staff members from 2/10/23 to 7/28/23.
 * 19 of the 24 new hires were possible in the first 3 months of offering the new base wages.
 * Of the 24 new hires, about 8 were let go prior to their 90 days for not being good fits for LOA. Another 8 also left for various reasons of moving or not wanting to be in childcare anymore. While the percentage of staff that left if high for many companies, this is a great improvement for many childcare centers. Getting quality candidate has been incredible difficult since the COVID pandemic so this is progress that a childcare center can be more selective on staff members.
 * LOA retention has grown our new staff and 7-12 months staff members while maintaining our greater than 1 year staff members.     1/26/23: 0-6 months: 16 staff members, 7-12 months: 3 staff members, 1yr1mo-2yr: 8 staff members, 2yr1mo-3yr: 3 staff members, >3yr: 3 staff members

Staff responses: 
 * Our staff was incredibly thankful for increase in wages and to be fully staffed.
 * Being fully staffed is helping give them time for lesson planning and planning for student enrichment activities to meet our mission statement.
